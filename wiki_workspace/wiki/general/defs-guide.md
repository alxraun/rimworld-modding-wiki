## Defs - Cheat Sheet

**What are Defs?**

- XML Definitions used to add content to RimWorld mods.
- Define game elements: weapons, apparel, animals, plants, factions, etc.
- Stored in XML files, human-readable, located in the `Defs` folder of a mod.
- Act as blueprints: define properties and configurations without code compilation.
- C# code provides behavior, Defs configure data.

**Folder Location:**

- Placed in `Defs` folder of mod's structure.
- XML files within `Defs` can be organized into subfolders (e.g., `ThingDefs_Items`, `RecipeDefs`).
- Filenames within `Defs` are for organization, except when using versioned LoadFolders.xml.
- Vanilla Defs location: `[RimWorld Install Folder]\Data\Core\Defs`.
- Use vanilla Defs as templates and examples.
