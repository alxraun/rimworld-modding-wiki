Roaring to go? [Here's a good tutorial that introduces a lot of things gradually](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Plague_Gun_(1.1) "Plague Gun (1.1)"). Want to take it slow? Smart. It's **strongly** recommended to do the following before you start making a mod:

# Step 1: Search for a mod already doing what you want[[edit](/index.php?title=Modding_Tutorials/First_Steps&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Step 1: Search for a mod already doing what you want")]

Seriously. There are so many mods, there is generally one, probably of high quality, doing what you want it to. You might not need to make a mod!

* Search [Steam's Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/about/?appid=294100). These have ready to go and managed by Steam mods. Click to use them.
* Check the [RimWorld Mod Forum](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?board=12.0)
* Use [Google](http://google.com) because it works.
* Ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RimWorld) or [reddit](https://reddit.com/r/RimWorld) to see if they know of one.

It's how most of us learned how2mod.

* Core. If it's (close to) something that already exists in RimWorld, use what RimWorld provides you. What better source of "how to do X" than the game itself?
* Maybe there's some inspiration [on this list of modders and their GitHub links](https://spdskatr.github.io/RWModdingResources/telephonebook)
* Use [GitHub search](https://github.com/search?q=RimWorld+worldcomponent&type=Code) to find how other modders handled a problem
* Use [Google](http://google.com) because it works.
